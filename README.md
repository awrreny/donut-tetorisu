# donut-tetorisu
Tetris client made in pygame.

Aside from typical tetris features, there are new moves called 'donut transformations' which allow different transformations on the tetris board.
<!-- explain different types of donut transformations
include images and defaults controls
'tetris on a donut' -->
These transformations become interesting when used to clear all the pieces on the board, i.e completing a perfect clear. For example, it is now possible to complete a perfect clear with 5 pieces using the pieces `T, S, Z, L, O`.

Edit `settings.py` to change controls and other settings, including move timings. 
The current move timings (`DAS`, `ARR`, etc.) are optimised for fast play like in tetr.io or jstris. The values commented out are more suitable for beginners.
